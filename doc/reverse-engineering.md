# ThermalMaster USB Protocol Documentation

A request for the official documentation was sent to the vendor. Until then, this
document captures what we have figured out so far to enable interoperability.

This documentation enables open-source developers to contribute to this driver.
No proprietary source code is reproduced.

## Supported Models

All models use VID 0x3474.

### Current-Generation Models (AC020-based)

| Model        | PID (hex)      | Resolution          | Notes                        |
| ------------ | -------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| X3           | 0x0020, 0x0021 | 384×288 @60Hz       | PID 0x0010 = bootloader      |
| X2 Pro       | 0x4141         | 256×192 @50Hz       | PID 0x4140 = bootloader      |
| X2L          | 0x4151         | 256×192 @50Hz       | PID 0x4150 = bootloader      |
| X15          | 0x4161, 0x41B2 | 256×192 @50Hz       | 0x41B2 = dual-system variant |
| X919         | 0x4171         | 256×192 @50Hz       |                              |
| P1           | 0x45C2         | 160×120             |                              |
| P2L / P2 Pro | 0x0001, 0x4281 | 256×192             |                              |
| P3           | 0x45A2         | 256×192 × 2 sensors | Manual focus, PCB inspection |
| P4           | 0x42A1         | 256×192             | Dual camera (IR + visible)   |

These all use the VDCMD command protocol described below.

### Legacy Models

| Model | PID (hex)      | Resolution    | Notes                                   |
| ----- | -------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| X2    | 0x5830, 0x5840 | 256×192 @25Hz | Distinguished from P2 by SN prefix "M2" |
| P2    | 0x5830, 0x5840 | 256×192 @25Hz | Distinguished from X2 by SN prefix "P2" |

These use a different UVC extension unit protocol (see [Legacy Protocol](#legacy-protocol-x2p2)).

## Command Protocol (VDCMD)

18-byte command buffer sent via USB vendor control transfer:

```
bmRequestType = 0x41 (OUT | VENDOR | INTERFACE)
bRequest      = 0x20
wValue        = 0x0000
wIndex        = 0x0000
data          = 18-byte command buffer
```

Wire format:

```
Bytes  0–1:  cmdType   (big-endian on wire, despite some docs saying LE)
Bytes  2–3:  param     (little-endian)
Bytes  4–5:  register  (little-endian)
Bytes  6–11: reserved  (zero)
Bytes 12–13: respLen   (little-endian)
Bytes 14–15: reserved  (zero)
Bytes 16–17: CRC16-CCITT over bytes 0–15
```

CmdID mapping (3-byte command identifier → wire format):

```
CmdID[0]   → param (low byte; high byte 0x00)
CmdID[1:2] → cmdType (LE encoding → stored BE on wire)
```

Example: CmdID {0x41, 0x2F, 0x01}
param = 0x0041
cmdType = LE(0x2F, 0x01) = 0x012F → stored as BE on wire: {0x01, 0x2F}

Response read uses:

```
bmRequestType = 0xC1 (IN | VENDOR | INTERFACE)
bRequest      = 0x21 (read response) or 0x22 (read status)
```

### Value Encoding

Commands place values in different positions depending on the type:

- **Register field** (bytes 4–5, LE uint16): brightness, contrast, emissivity, etc.
- **Single byte** (byte 5 only): palette index, gain. Byte 4 left zero.
- **Register + data** (bytes 4–5 register, bytes 6–7 data): cursor position (X, Y).

### Read Pattern

Standard read sequence (send command → read status → read response → read status):

```
1. Control(0x41, 0x20, 0, 0, 18-byte-cmd)    → send command
2. Control(0xC1, 0x22, 0, 0, 1-byte-buf)      → read status (ACK)
3. Control(0xC1, 0x21, 0, 0, N-byte-buf)      → read response data
4. Control(0xC1, 0x22, 0, 0, 1-byte-buf)      → read status (ACK)
```

### Write Pattern

Standard write sequence (send command → read status):

```
1. Control(0x41, 0x20, 0, 0, 18-byte-cmd)    → send command
2. Control(0xC1, 0x22, 0, 0, 1-byte-buf)      → read status (ACK)
```

### Zoom Commands

Hardware zoom command IDs exist in the protocol:

| Command                   | CmdID              | Encoding                           |
| ------------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Center zoom set           | {0x42, 0x31, 0x01} | byte[5] = `round(zoom_float * 10)` |
| Center zoom get           | {0x82, 0x31, 0x01} | response byte / 10.0 = zoom_float  |
| Coordinate zoom set       | {0x51, 0x31, 0x01} | byte[5] = zoom, byte[8] = param    |
| Equal proportion zoom set | {0x52, 0x31, 0x01} | byte[5] = zoom, byte[8] = param    |

The zoom float is validated in range [1.0, 8.0] and encoded as
`int((zoom + 0.05) * 10.0)` — the 0.05 is a rounding epsilon. So 1.0× → 10,
2.0× → 20, 8.0× → 80.

**Status: non-functional on tested firmware.** P3 firmware (v00.00.02.17) accepts
these commands without error but silently ignores them. `GetCenterZoom` always
returns 10 (1.0×). Investigation confirms:

- The zoom command IDs are not exposed via the camera's JNI interface
- No application code path invokes these commands for any model
- Both official apps implement zoom as software scaling (Android `View.setScaleX/Y`)
- WiFi-connected cameras receive electronic zoom via socket protocol
  (command type `0x09`, value = `int(zoom_float * 10)`)

## Legacy Protocol (X2/P2)

Older X2/P2 models (PID 0x5830/0x5840) use a different UVC extension unit
protocol with a three-phase command cycle:

```
Phase 1 (SET):    Control(0x41, 0x45, 0x0078, 0x9D00, 8-byte-cmd, 1000ms)
Phase 2 (COMMIT): Control(0x41, 0x45, 0x0078, 0x1D08, 8-byte-buf, 1000ms)
Phase 3 (POLL):   Control(0xC1, 0x44, 0x0078, 0x0200, 1-byte-status, 1000ms)
                  Loop up to 1000× until status indicates completion.
```

This protocol is NOT supported by current-generation models (returns
`libusb: i/o error` on P3).

### Legacy Zoom Commands (Step-Based)

The legacy protocol uses incremental zoom (step up/down) rather than
absolute zoom values:

| Command            | CmdID (LE uint16) | Parameters                  |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | --------------------------- |
| Center zoom up     | 0x0112            | channel, step               |
| Center zoom down   | 0x0212            | channel, step               |
| Position zoom up   | 0x0312            | channel, step, x(BE), y(BE) |
| Position zoom down | 0x0412            | channel, step, x(BE), y(BE) |

8-byte data buffer layout:

```
[0:1] = CmdID (little-endian)
[2]   = previewPathChannel
[3]   = zoomScaleStep (1–4)
[4:5] = x position (big-endian, position variants only)
[6:7] = y position (big-endian, position variants only)
```

These commands are wired to JNI for the `USB_IR_256_384` device type but
are never called from any code path in either official app.

### Poll Status Logic

The status byte returned by Phase 3 is interpreted as:

- Bit 0 set → busy, retry
- Bit 1 set AND value ≤ 3 → busy, retry
- 0 → success
- Other → error

## Native Library Architecture

The camera SDK uses several native libraries. This section documents which
library handles which device type — useful for understanding protocol
differences across models.

| Library                       | Purpose                                  | Used by                                     |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| AC020 SDK library             | Camera I/O, AC020-based devices          | X3, X2 Pro, X2L, X15, X919, P1, P2L, P3, P4 |
| AC020 command library         | VDCMD command protocol                   | Same as above                               |
| Legacy command library        | UVC extension unit protocol              | X2, P2 (legacy)                             |
| AC020 temperature library     | Temperature measurement                  | AC020-based devices                         |
| USB UVC camera library        | USB transport layer, modified libuvc     | All models                                  |
| Omnibus IR camera library     | libusb_control_transfer wrapper          | AC020-based devices                         |
| WN 640/384 libraries (v1, v2) | For WN-series modules (640×512, 384×288) | Not used by ThermalMaster-branded products  |

### AC020 Command Library — Exposed Functions

The AC020 command library's JNI interface exposes 156+ commands covering:
palette, gain, FFC/shutter, brightness, contrast, noise reduction, scene mode,
mirror/flip, emissivity, environment correction, isothermal, edge enhance,
cursor, DPC calibration, streaming, heartbeat, device info, and more.

Zoom functions exist as exported C symbols but are **not registered** in the
JNI method table (156 entries, zero zoom-related). They are dead code —
exported but with no callers from any direction (no internal calls, no
cross-library imports, no JNI binding, no Java callers).

## Frame Format

### P3 Dual-Sensor Frame

The P3 has two sensors — both 256×192:

1. **IR brightness sensor** — 8-bit grayscale, hardware AGC'd. Used for
   visible-light-like imagery and as a guide for edge-preserving upsampling
   of thermal data.
2. **Thermal sensor** — 14-bit raw thermal values (16-bit words). Encodes
   actual temperature-proportional data.

Each USB bulk frame contains both sensors interleaved by rows:

```
Row layout (FrameRows = 2 * SensorH + 2 = 386 rows):
  Rows   0–191:  IR brightness data (256 × 192 × 2 bytes/pixel, LE uint16)
  Rows 192–193:  2 separator/metadata rows
  Rows 194–385:  Thermal data (256 × 192 × 2 bytes/pixel, LE uint16)
```

Total frame size: `2 × 386 × 256 = 197,632 bytes`.

The driver can extract:

- IR only — 8-bit per pixel, suitable for visible-light preview
- Thermal only — 16-bit raw thermal values
- Both — for joint bilateral upsampling (blended mode)

### P1 Frame

Same layout, 160×120 per sensor. Frame size: `2 × 242 × 160 = 77,440 bytes`.

## Streaming Protocol

### Start Sequence

```
1. Control(0x41, 0x20, 0, 0, CmdStartStream)  → 18-byte start stream command
2. Sleep 1s
3. SetInterfaceAlt(1, 1)                        → activate streaming alt setting
4. Control(0x40, 0xEE, 0, 1, nil)               → device-level stream trigger
5. Sleep 2s
6. BulkRead(0x81, dummy)                        → dummy read to clear pipe
7. Control(0x41, 0x20, 0, 0, CmdStatus)         → status command
```

### Stop Sequence

```
1. SetInterfaceAlt(1, 0)                        → streaming idle
```

### Frame Data

Read via bulk IN endpoint 0x81. Each frame has 12-byte start and end markers
with frame counters for synchronization.

## USB Interface Layout

```
Interface 0, Alt 0:  Control — vendor control transfers for commands
Interface 1, Alt 0:  Streaming idle (no endpoints)
Interface 1, Alt 1:  Streaming active — bulk IN endpoint 0x81
```

## UVC Compatibility

The P3 presents `bInterfaceClass=0x0E` (USB Video Class) on its interfaces, so
the kernel's `uvcvideo` driver will attempt to bind. However, it cannot function
as a standard UVC camera because:

1. **Custom initialization required.** Streaming requires a proprietary startup
   sequence: vendor control transfers (`bRequest=0x20` with 18-byte commands,
   `bRequest=0xEE` device-level trigger), specific timing delays, and a dummy
   bulk read — none of which the kernel UVC driver knows about.

2. **Proprietary frame format.** Frames contain interleaved dual-sensor data
   (IR brightness + thermal + metadata rows) with custom 12-byte start/end
   markers. This is not YUY2, NV12, MJPEG, or any format the UVC driver
   can interpret.

3. **Bulk transfers.** The P3 uses bulk IN transfers for video data, not the
   isochronous transfers typical of UVC cameras.

### UVC Descriptor Parsing

The camera SDK parses standard UVC descriptor subtypes for its internal device
enumeration: VS_INPUT_HEADER (1), VS_FORMAT_UNCOMPRESSED (4),
VS_FRAME_UNCOMPRESSED (5/7), VS_FORMAT_MJPEG (6), VS_FORMAT_FRAME_BASED (0x10),
VS_FRAME_FRAME_BASED (0x11).

The SDK requires `bInterfaceClass==0x0E && bInterfaceSubClass==0x01` on the
control interface. A vendor-specific fallback (`bInterfaceClass==0xFF`) exists
only for VID `0x199e` (a different vendor, not ThermalMaster).

### Workaround

The `thermalmaster-v4l2loopback` tool serves as a userspace proxy: it handles
the proprietary protocol, extracts/processes frames, and writes standard video
formats (RGB24, GRAY8, GRAY16LE) to a v4l2loopback device. Any application
(OBS, mpv, Chrome, etc.) then sees a normal V4L2 camera.
